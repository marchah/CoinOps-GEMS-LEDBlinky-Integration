# CoinOps GEMS LEDBlinky Integration
 

 This in a WIP for integrated LEDBlinbky into CoinOps Gems

 Feel free to create a ticket about suggestions, ideas and imporvements.

## Notes

- If you use an IPAC Ultimate I/O, you will have to configure the board in DInput, Xinput protocol doesn't support it. On IPAC software to map the input you will have use the right joystick instead of the Dpad and will have to invert `Select` and `Start`
